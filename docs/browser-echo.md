Browser Echo (Next.js)
======================

Reference: https://github.com/instructa/browser-echo/blob/main/packages/next/README.md

This repository integrates streaming UI already, but if you want to adopt Browser Echo’s Next.js helpers for client/server streaming glue, follow the README above. It covers:

- Installation and setup steps for the Next.js package
- Server route handler examples
- Client usage patterns

Notes
- This file intentionally links to the canonical README rather than duplicating it to avoid drift.
- If you’d like, I can wire up a minimal example route and component using Browser Echo once the package is installed.
